# Sales Trend Analysis Using Power BI

## 📊 Overview 

This comprehensive analysis addresses a key stakeholder question: **What is the sales trend by month and how does it depend on the sales method, reason, country, and sellers?**

Power BI was utilised as the primary data analytical tool to provide data-driven insights and actionable recommendations.

## 🎯 Research Questions

To provide a complete answer, the analysis was structured around six key questions:

1. **What kind of monthly sales volume trend exists?**
2. **What is the monthly sales trend by sales method (online vs. offline)?**
3. **In which countries is sales volume higher?**
4. **What is the main reason driving sales?**
5. **Which sellers occupy leading positions in sales and sales volume?**

## 🔍 Key Findings

The analysis revealed the following insights about monthly sales trends:

### Sales Growth Pattern
- **Steady growth** observed from 2001 to 2003
- Orders are primarily made **online**, but **offline orders generate higher profits** in the second half of the year

### Geographic Distribution
- **United States** leads in order volume

### Customer Behavior
- Primary purchase drivers: **price and promotions**

### Top Performers
- **Leading seller**: the seller with an ID-276 (US market)

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis findings, we recommend:

### 1. Investigate Online vs. Offline Profit Disparity
**Issue**: Online sales generate less profit despite higher volume

**Potential causes**:
- Lower pricing strategy for online products
- Product type differences (large/expensive items sold offline vs. small/cheaper items online)

**Action**: Analyse product categories by sales channel to identify pricing optimisation opportunities

### 2. Explore European Market Potential
**Issue**: Lower sales volume in Europe compared to other regions

**Investigation areas**:
- Regional staffing levels comparison
- Market-specific factors affecting sales performance
- Localisation opportunities
